# byu-theme-style-helpers
Provide baseline styles and variables for the BYU 2017 theme.

This repo contains a collection of short css files that can be referenced to easily add styles to existing websites. 

In most cases, they provide classes like .byu-button and .byu-table-header. Classes being with "byu-" for namespacing reasons,
so it will ideally not interfere with existing styling.

There are some exceptions, where it is directly styling elements. The font-related files, for example, set fonts for 
headings and paragraphs and divs, etc. In these cases, the files are CAPITALIZED and you should review them thoroughly before loading them on your site.
